To this very special edition of THE e-life podcast. Why is it special. Because it's our fiftieth episode and we've decided to mark that milestone by focusing on a field that's huge and tiny both at the same time huge in terms of the rate at which the discipline is growing and the impact that it's set to have on our lives and tiny because its subjects are microscopic. If you've not guessed it yet it is of course our microbiome that community of microorganisms that live on us and in us and outnumber our human cells by maybe 50 fold. We literally passengers in our own bodies. Hello Im Chris Smith from The Naked Scientist. And in the next 30 minutes we're going to learn how gut bacteria might alter your risk of diabetes and how the microbiome can even manipulate your mood. But first beginning at the top end and with what we put into our mouths. Sarah Demsey has been looking at the effects of feeding mice on a diet enriched with linoleic acid an essential fatty acid that we eat an awful lot of these days.
