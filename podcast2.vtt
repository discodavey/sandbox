[00:00:14.020] - SPEAKER: M1
Hello welcome to Episode 51 of the e-life podcast I'm Chris Smith the Naked scientists in this episode. The effect of climate change on the spread of mosquito borne diseases. Lightning strikes twice as another transmissible cancer surfaces amongst Tasmanian devils and new insights into how else do works in the brain. But first one prediction is that by about mid century over three quarters of the human population. And that by the way is destined to reach 10 billion by then we'll live in a city and cities themselves will of course need to grow to accommodate this burgeoning populace but will they'll expand into will inevitably be the habitats of wild animals with what effect our real Parsons has been trying to answer this question in the US.

[00:01:00.850] - SPEAKER: F5
The idea is that these cities are out of ecological balance that humans have taken away too much of their natural habitat and too much of kind of the natural systems and so they're not really functioning to the same level as we would expect of wild ecosystems. And so we wanted to look at that in terms of the many communities and compare to cities in the United States. Raleigh North Carolina. In Washington D.C. to nearby wild areas and see if we could see any differences in terms of diversity so the number of animals present and then the relative abundance so kind of the population sizes or some estimate of the population sizes of each species seems like a very tall order.

[00:01:40.660] - SPEAKER: M1
How did you do it.

[00:01:41.680] - SPEAKER: F5
It is indeed harder. And so we had that cover of these really large areas in both cities to get kind of an idea of these communities in a very suburban areas all the way out to the more wild areas and then to do that. We used citizen scientists to run Kimerer traps devices that we can put out in a forest or in a yard when an animal walks by it senses the body heat and the movement and it magically takes a series of pictures. Without these volunteers it isn't scientists we simply couldn't have covered the areas that were necessary for this study.

[00:02:15.700] - SPEAKER: M1
Where were they deploying their cameras low.

[00:02:18.460] - SPEAKER: F5
We asked them to deploy them in different areas around these cities that were based on housing density so areas of highest housing density are what we call suburban areas. And then as we step down in housing density we get to these wild areas citizen scientists then put those cameras in yards and also in forested areas both small forest fragments less than a square kilometer and large force fragments.

[00:02:43.990] - SPEAKER: M1
And how do you log all the data.

[00:02:46.120] - SPEAKER: F5
We use software called e-mail a network that helps camer trappers organize their data and that software allows our volunteers to go through all the pictures that they collect and identify the species in them. Then they upload the data to us so that we can look at it and make sure that they've correctly identified species. There are some some tricky ones here. Why. Why are they tricky. Yeah yeah. So we have to a species we have the Redfox then we've also have the grey fox and there of smaller size and especially at night these cameras they're black and white. It's an infrared flash so we can't see whether their coat is red or black and so there are some characteristics especially of that tail that make it easy to distinguish but our volunteers sometimes have trouble.

[00:03:31.930] - SPEAKER: M1
But assuming that your volunteers were diligent and they weren't too easily confused what did you find.

[00:03:37.990] - SPEAKER: F5
So we found rather surprisingly that the diversity so the number of species that we were getting on our cameras was not significantly different between the suburban areas and the wild areas. And in fact in Raleigh the diversity was significantly higher in the suburban areas compared to the wild areas. We did have some exceptions for example we only found beaver in the suburban areas and we never actually detected it in the wild areas and we never got bears in the suburban areas.

[00:04:07.870] - SPEAKER: M1
I guess that's a bit of a relief in some respects isn't it.

[00:04:11.760] - SPEAKER: F5
Yes it is. At the same time we know it bears actually can do quite well in suburban areas. The tricky thing is making sure they stay wild so especially not letting them get into trash cans and allowing them to maintain their distance even if they're living close to us.

[00:04:29.860] - SPEAKER: M3
Does one take away from this then that contrary to the prevailing view that these urban environments are really bad for wildlife in fact the opposite is true.

[00:04:41.110] - SPEAKER: F5
Yeah I think in terms of these mammals and it is important to say that these memos that we were sampling with our carers are mammals that are chipmunk sized and up. So there are a number of male male species that this wouldn't apply to but certainly in these two cities it seems as if this idea of ecological function being different. I mean suburban and wild areas at least as it applies to the mammalian community is maybe not the case but there have been a number of studies on other taxa showing that urban areas and suburban areas do have quite drastic negative effects and so we want to be very cautious about extending this you know to other taxa in other cities even.

[00:05:21.410] - SPEAKER: M3
So what about other cities. Because obviously you've looked at just two you looked at a lot of animals and a big area admittedly but it is just two zones isn't it. So what would happen do you think if you went elsewhere both in the US and maybe even further worldwide.

[00:05:35.780] - SPEAKER: F5
Yeah and that's something that we're very very interested in doing. We're really interested in looking at cities that have an impact apex predator in the east in these cities. Of course there were once mountain lions and Walt they are here no longer but there are cities in the United States where the foxes the raccoons etc. still persist in the presence of an apex predator like a mountain lion or a wolf. And we would expect then perhaps the dynamics to be a little bit different. And then the same kind of thinking about a series around the world. Of course cities in different parts of the world are in Europe for example tend to be more concentrated less sprawling. The separation between urban and suburban and wild tends to be very stark whereas here there's quite a lot of sprawl. And so we would then expect it to be more difficult for animals to go in those smaller concentrated European cities from the wild straight into the suburban areas. But it's something that we're very interested in in looking into further and we actually have some partners in Germany right now that are just beginning a replication of this study.

[00:06:44.690] - SPEAKER: M1
Orial Parsons she's based at North Carolina State University. Now speaking of urban dwelling most of the world's big cities are sited in places where the conditions are ideal for human habitation. And often our ancestors chose those locations for their settlements to avoid diseases for instance. They didn't go near swamps so they wouldn't be plagued by mosquitoes. But with climate change in the future some of these urban venues are going to become much more propitious for mosquitoes and therefore the diseases that they vector. So is there a way to tell which ones matter rocket hit upon the idea of using Australia as a giant petri dish to find out the country so big that it exhibits a broad temperature range across the continent and the use of a single health care system means theres a really excellent data set on at least one mosquito borne disease. And that's roster of a virus. So she's been able to model accurately how temperature affects mosquito behaviour and disease transmission.

[00:07:41.840] - SPEAKER: F2
My lab was really interested in trying to figure out how temperature affects the spread of infectious diseases and specifically infectious diseases that are spread by mosquitoes. We know that climate change is going to be changing the temperatures that we observe and adjust what those temperatures are but when they occur in the year and we know that temperature has a really big impact in the way that mosquito bodies work.

[00:08:11.300] - SPEAKER: M1
So basically what you're saying is if climate change changes the temperature the temperature changes the behaviour of potential vectors like mosquitoes and that means that the dynamics of how diseases may spread will be secondarily affected.

[00:08:24.650] - SPEAKER: F2
Yes exactly. And it's not even just behaviour in the way that we typically think about outlay where we go on and how far they fly but every aspect of how their body functions how long they have how many eggs they how quickly they turn from our eggs into a Dotts how good their body is their transmitting the virus because the disease has to go from their stomach to their salary glands and so that process depends really sensitively on temperature.

[00:08:57.740] - SPEAKER: M1
So given that how can you make predictions about what impacts climate change is likely to have on things like emerging infectious diseases and the distribution of the diseases we already do have.

[00:09:10.340] - SPEAKER: F2
One way that you can do that is by building a model and so by model we basically just mean an equation that lets us turn bodily functions things like life span egg production then how good you are transmitting the disease in to an overall prediction for a disease spread. And so we can t now experiment data where people are actually taking mosquitoes and put them in incubators at different temperatures and measure how all those processes are affected by Carriger. And then we can come up with an overall equation through how we think temperature affects the spread of disease.

[00:09:53.450] - SPEAKER: M1
That tells you what your model thinks is going to happen how do you validated.

[00:09:58.250] - SPEAKER: F2
So that's a great question. And unnoted has the smile. We basically need to take human cases for different diseases and say how much do these current cases of diseases match what we would predict based just on the model. So what disease did you actually look at still from the study we were looking at a disease called Ross River virus. It's the most common mosquito borne disease in Australia. The reason why we were so interested in Ratta of a virus is that Australia is basically perfect to study how temperature affects mosquito borne disease. Because Australia is a huge continent that stretches from very trapping areas in the north to much cooler areas in the south but throughout that entire range there is a single case reporting system. So we have a really good deal for both the human cases weather data and in some cases even in mosquito data. We can use all of those pieces to try and test our model that was based just on data from web experience.

[00:11:07.390] - SPEAKER: M1
Right. So because you've got this broad range of different temperatures across the continent and you can see how in the present situation that temperature and the seasonal data alters the behavior of the mosquitoes you can then use that to say well if climate change causes areas to become warmer or colder accordingly we would anticipate that we'll see what currently happens in that geography happening in this new geography and therefore this is what the likely outcomes will be exactly.

[00:11:36.180] - SPEAKER: F2
And actually one of our main conclusions is that we expect to see different impacts of temperature increases in the different regions. Sue It turns out that there is a best temperature for the spread of mosquito borne diseases and it tends to be kind of a middle intermediate temperature so areas that are already really warm maybe you bake Ray at best temperature when they get warmer. We'll actually see that disease transmission will probably decrease because it will become too warm. Unfortunately most people in Australia currently live in the southern part of the country which is right now below that best temperature. And so in general we probably expect to see more cases of the after of a virus due to climate change.

[00:12:27.590] - SPEAKER: M1
So perhaps not the news you'd hope for if you live in Australia. Stanford University's Marter shock it must begin with Australia. In recent years we've realised that some cancers can spread not just round the body but between individuals and are a striking example of this is devil facial tumour disease that's wiping out the Tasmanian Devil. We think that when these animals fight cancerous tissue from one can be injected into another animal by bite there it takes root and grows using an immune trick to prevent it from being rejected by its new host. Recently scientists discovered a new form of devil facial tumour disease DFT to which is distinct from the first one. This hasn't evolved to hide from the immune system yet but if it does evolve to do that then it could be curtains for the species. Hannah Siddall is studying these diseases at the University of South Hampton.

[00:13:20.420] - SPEAKER: F3
Not many people know that some cancers can actually become transmissible. And what we've been interested in is to transmissible tumours that have occurred in the Tasmanian Devil which is a must see species endemic to the island of Tasmania and in the mid 1990s a really nasty transmissible tumour emerged called devil facial tumour one 51 and it's had a really negative impact on the population. So in some areas 90 percent of the Devils have actually died. But our most recent work is actually on a more recently emerged contagious cancer in the Tasmanian Devil. So this is a species where lightning has kind of struck twice if you like.

[00:13:58.400] - SPEAKER: M2
How does the cancer spread from one Tasmanian Devil to another.

[00:14:01.910] - SPEAKER: F3
We think that this is actually caused by biting. Now this new transmissible tumor 52 which emerged only quite recently also looks a lot like 51. And actually if you looked at these two tumors even though they're completely different diseases they look really similar. So they still cause these huge tumors around the faces of the animals. So we deserved to we haven't shown this experimentally back. We think that they're also passed by biting.

[00:14:28.090] - SPEAKER: M2
There is a number of years ago that Amori Pearce put some cells from the first of these types of tumors under a microscope and she showed that they had to be clonal it was exactly the same genetics in each of them. So how did this second type of tumour emerge and how do you know that that's history repeating itself or as you put it lightning striking twice.

[00:14:48.650] - SPEAKER: F3
Yeah that's a really good question because actually I mean what you'd kind of assume is that this new tumor would be somehow related to the first human right that would that would feel more obvious I think because of how rare these are but actually when people first discovered this second tumor and it looked exactly the same but they found that it expressed some proteins on the cell surface of the tumor cells that were different to DFT. And then looking a little bit deeper at the genetics they found that actually the carrier type or the chromosomes of this new tumor were really different to the 51 the first tumor and then going even deeper and looking at some of the specific genetic markers they were different as well and they were also different to the host animals. So from this it's really clear that this new tumor actually emerged in a completely independent animal completely different animal that came from a different part of Tasmania and lived much more recently.

[00:15:48.440] - SPEAKER: M2
One of the first things that you published on this was the discovery as to why when you put foreign tissue from one of these animals into another animal the immune system doesn't recognize it and get rid of it. Why is that.

[00:16:02.570] - SPEAKER: F3
So initially when we were looking at this disease in Tasmanian devils there was we thought that it was just because they had low genetic diversity. And that's why we could have have these cells grafting if you like us as a graft between them because we know in humans and mice that you can't just take skin cells skin or kidney and transplant it to someone else it just doesn't work the immune system sees that it rejects it. And what we were able to show with the first Shearmur is that the tumor cells have down regulated or lost with the important molecules from the cell surface which are called MHC class 1 molecules and the tumor has cleverly lost these to make it invisible to a certain subset of the cells are called T cells. And so that's had one really probably became so dangerous and managed to kill so many levels it flies under the radar.

[00:16:55.340] - SPEAKER: M2
Yeah that's right yes it does. Does the second type that you're now describing pulled the same stunt.

[00:17:01.100] - SPEAKER: F3
Yeah. So that's that's what we were asking the question in this paper and as so often happens in science you start out answering one question and actually you end a half entering something different. But we did manage to answer that first question and to our surprise the second Schumer DFT too still expressed MHC class 1 2 Like how. How is it possibly moving between individuals and I think in this paper that with actually being able to conclude this 100 percent. But what we've proposed based on our results is that actually the Chima and the host animals that are within that population actually share a lot of the MHC class 1 molecules. So in the human population we have so much what we call diversity of genetic diversity in these molecules that you can do transplants but we think that perhaps that this tumor has kind of stayed at the moment within its like favorite animals that have very similar MHC molecules to what it has.

[00:18:01.500] - SPEAKER: M2
It's sort of showing us how it one could have evolved in the first place. It could have started out a bit like this and then it evolved to have this this down regulation of the immune response. This one is now doing exactly the same thing.

[00:18:12.750] - SPEAKER: F4
Yes and if that's why we're really concerned about how quickly the new tumor could spread because of the fact that it has expressed MHC class one has kind of held it back or kept it in a constrained population. If it loses MHC class one presumably those constraints are off and it could really spread and transmit much more easily. And from what we know at the moment it seems as if it is just as aggressive in terms of killing the animals as City 51. And then fortunately though we have far fewer devils they have less genetic diversity than they did you know 20 years ago before they got in any of these diseases.

[00:18:52.080] - SPEAKER: M2
So we have a much more vulnerable species than looking on the bright side does what you've discovered shed any light on how we might be able to stop this thing.

[00:19:01.680] - SPEAKER: F4
Yeah that's kind of the million dollar question isn't it. And I wish I had a better answer to that. One thing that my lab is working on is trying to design better vaccine strategies against this and you know that is a pretty tall order but we have had some success against DDT one that still needs more work. But the bat does look as if it's promising. And I think at the moment though it's really getting a better understanding of these tumors because if you think about if we didn't even know that these tumors were losing MHC class one we might be quite complacent that this tumour was just going to stay confined to these animals. So really understanding and I think that's a general lesson isn't it. The more we understand about how diseases and pathogens work then you know the more chance we have of being able to come up with ways of preventing them spreading further.

[00:19:50.250] - SPEAKER: M1
Well as they say the devil is in the detail. Hannah Siddall there you're listening to the e-life podcast with me. Chris Smith still to come if your lab is headed by a woman when it comes to getting your paper published is that a good thing or might it be a bad thing. We'll find out before that vote. April the 19th 1943 is a very special day for some and it's commemorated as bicycle day. It's in fact the day that Albert Hofmann a chemist working in the Sandal's pharmaceutical laboratories in Basel took a dose of the l'Est do lysergic acid Dyea file amide that he developed in his laboratory as he rode his bike home after swallowing the chemical. Strange experiences began to unfold since then we've learned a lot more about how this chemical affects the brain. And now thanks to a recent study by Catrin Perella at the University of Zurich appropriate enough. Also Hoffmann's own alma martyr. We now know which chemical receptors seem to be responsible for many of the effects of LSD in the human brain.

[00:20:49.230] - SPEAKER: F6
We have healthy participants in the MRI scanner. They know when to read rUK conditions. The first condition is just a placebo condition. The second condition was participants received a hundred microgram of LACMA and the third condition it was a condition where participants received cat Enza in which blocks a very specific receptor in the brain which scored the serotonin into a receptor and after that we gave them the LCT to find out which effects that Ellas to induce are dependent on this particular receptor and who were the participants.

[00:21:28.440] - SPEAKER: M1
What can you tell us about them in terms of what you knew about them when they embarked on the study participants were 20 to 40 years old.

[00:21:36.210] - SPEAKER: F6
They were all healthy most of them were students or interested people and had any of them used LSD recreationally or did you not ask that. Oh yes we did ask them about half of them didn't have any prior experience. The other half did have prior experience but none of them are regular users of psychedelics or any other substances.

[00:21:58.230] - SPEAKER: M1
What sorts of experiences did the participants say they got when they took the drug.

[00:22:02.910] - SPEAKER: F6
First of all what people notice is a visual alteration. They see the floor moving they see collars changing things might appear brighter people feel some kind of disembodiment boundaries between yourself and the environment tend to dissolve as well as feeling more connected to other people and to your environment so people tend to call these operations in self experience and when you then put them in the brain scanner do any of the changes you see explain the experiences that people describe. Absolutely. What we see is that there are certain areas in the brain which are dedicated to our sensory and sensory motor experiences. Those areas are connected more strongly with each other so they communicate more. And there are other areas in the brain which are dedicated to integrating these experiences and making decisions planning and associations and those brain areas. They are collected less and the influence of LSD. And if you think about what else do you think that makes a lot of sense so that sensory awareness is enhanced but it can maybe not be integrated well which then leads to hallucinations and differences in self experience.

[00:23:28.490] - SPEAKER: M1
What about when you gave them the tensor and the blocker for the serotonin receptors that you think might interrupt the LSD signal. Did that change their experience.

[00:23:37.880] - SPEAKER: F6
Absolutely. And this was actually quite surprising for us because LSD stimulates quite a lot of receptors not only this particular one that we were blocking and from animal studies to knew that more of their receptors that LSD stimulates are involved in the subjective effects were when they blocked this particular receptor using CAD Ezrin all the effects basically went away they got normalized to a placebo level so participants weren't able to distinguish between LSD plus cadenzas in and the placebo condition. That means that serotonin receptor is crucial for the effects of LSD. And also when we looked at our from our data all the effects that LSD was having on brain connectivity were basically gone. There was no difference anymore between that cat or in plus LSD and their placebo condition.

[00:24:29.120] - SPEAKER: M1
Now given what you've learned from this study what are the implications of this and might even be therapeutic implications.

[00:24:37.160] - SPEAKER: F6
Yes we know that LSD induces effects similar to some of the symptoms we see in schizophrenia for example. So one of the years is dead. We could for example use the function our connectivity maps that we have seen here compare them with connectivity mouse from patients and therefore find out who would be most likely to respond to a particular medication. The other one is Esmie he received that the alterations in the house lack connectivity that lead to these loosening of self boundaries that might be something that is actually helpful in patients like depression who suffer from rumination and increased self focus. And I think the alterations induced by LC here might explain a mechanism why these psychedelics might work in a patient population.

[00:25:33.530] - SPEAKER: M1
Catrin Perella here at the e-life podcast we try to create audio abstracts of some of the most important papers that are carried by the journal in recent weeks but in each episode we also try to shine the spotlight on some significant issues that are faced by practising scientists. One of these is the rigor of peer review where new science is scrutinised by authorities in the field before it's accepted for mainstream publication. But is this process done fairly in the spirit of transparency. E-life made available to one of its editors John for Romand details of every manuscript ever submitted to the journal since its launch. She told me what she and her colleagues discovered when they analyze the data.

[00:26:14.150] - SPEAKER: F7
Well the fundamental question is whether journals when they review scientific papers are finding the best science or whether there are other factors biases that could be influencing the review process. The journals use to decide which research to publish.

[00:26:30.890] - SPEAKER: M3
Now when you say finding the best science of course journals don't go looking for publications it's the other way round isn't it correct.

[00:26:36.110] - SPEAKER: F7
The processes are there submit a manuscript that they would like to have published in the journal and then the editors first make a preliminary decision there's this work interesting enough for potentially interesting enough to send to members of the scientific community for peer review and typically three reviewers will rate comments about the paper send it back to the editors and a decision is rendered.

[00:26:59.900] - SPEAKER: M3
Now that sounds fair enough and in fact peer review is held up as the gold standard in how we should do things so what's your beef with that.

[00:27:08.000] - SPEAKER: F7
The problem is that scientists are people only know that people are influenced by all kinds of cognitive biases.

[00:27:15.950] - SPEAKER: M3
So can I paraphrase you're saying then I get your paper and I decide for whatever reason best known to me I dont like you so I'm actually going to can your paper I'm going to say it's really bad it's lots of methodological flaws or whatever and I'm going to say let's kill it and let's not publish it.

[00:27:31.400] - SPEAKER: F7
Sure there can have been what we found in this study is more that people tend to give kind of an advantage to people who share certain characteristics with themselves and those characteristics include gender and nationality.

[00:27:46.370] - SPEAKER: M3
That's quite a claim. So how did you actually do the study. Let's look at the method first. I mean when I actually look at the results. Talk us through how you approach this.

[00:27:53.900] - SPEAKER: F7
First of all we were very excited to get access to these data every manuscript ever submitted to the journal e-life since its inception. First of all we did. It has been done a number of times. Look at the differences in success rates of authors with different demographic characteristics women versus men people from the US UK Germany China Japan. So we ask what are the differences in success rates but there can be differences in success rates that are not reflecting bias because it may be that the papers coming from certain groups are just of better quality either because they've had certain advantages like access to research resources or time or encouragement or other kinds of things. So seeing differences in success rates doesn't mean there's bias and conversely equal success rates doesn't mean there's no bias because it could be that one group was actually better but had that equal success rate. So to try to get beyond that we looked at how successful men were when reviewed by all male reviewers vs. reviewers of mixed gender and how successful they were when reviewed by reviewers from the US vs. other countries and just to be clear when you say success that a paper gets sent to the journal it passes muster and ends up in print.

[00:29:13.430] - SPEAKER: M3
That's right. And what does that show when you feed these data through your sieve. What trends come out.

[00:29:20.000] - SPEAKER: F7
Oh we found is that the decision that the reviewers made about whether a paper should be published was not just implied by the contents of paper but it was influenced by the demographics by the gender and by the nationality of the authors and by the gender and nationality of the reviewers. Male reviewers were more likely to accept a paper from a male author. People from a given country were more likely to accept a paper from somebody from their own country so we called this homophily.

[00:29:51.770] - SPEAKER: M3
Was it just that one way street was it just men favouring men or did women tend to give more benefit of the doubt to other women authors.

[00:29:58.700] - SPEAKER: F7
There was a suggestion that may be the case that women also give the advantage to women but they were not enough cases of papers from women being reviewed by all female reviewer panels because women are highly underrepresented at every stage of science and in fact we found that they were underrepresented as reviewers too. And when I say underrepresented I dont just mean that not 50 percent. I mean compared to there compared to the number of women in the scientific community they were invited to review papers less often than their male colleagues.

[00:30:31.670] - SPEAKER: M3
It's about 30 percent isn't it if you look at the workforce about one in three scientists is female. Two in three are male. That's right and that's going to inevitably be reflected if you think about well that's the pool of expertise we've got to rely on. It's probably going to be reflected in editorial boards and review panels and referees ship as well.

[00:30:50.320] - SPEAKER: F7
It's worse than that. We see that women are less represented as reviewers than they are as authors so the author Paul should be the same as the reviewer Paul. And so we find that there's even less representation of women than we'd expect based on how many of them are submitting papers.

[00:31:08.450] - SPEAKER: M3
So you find that theres this Ofelia effect. Men look after men women look after women. Does that apply regardless of who else is in the author list. So if you've got say a female first author but a male senior author does that skew things or does it all right on whether there's a woman's name there.

[00:31:26.330] - SPEAKER: F7
We didn't find any effect of the gender of the first author and it's really senior Arthur kind of the head of the research laboratory whose gender matters and that makes sense because I think often the reviewers know the head of the lab but might not know who the graduates doing their Postdoctoral Fellow is who's doing the research.

[00:31:46.520] - SPEAKER: M3
Is one interpretation of that then that if I work for a female senior author and I send my paper off I'm male I nonetheless might face a publication bias against me owing to the fact that as a boss who's a female that's true it looks like papers coming from a given library are influenced by the demographics of their senior out there and these were statistically significant differences. These were statistically significant differences yes but obviously a statistician knows that that could mean if you do a big enough study which you did do a huge study here is thousands of papers you can detect a very very tiny difference so how big was the difference in practical terms.

[00:32:24.380] - SPEAKER: F7
What we saw was overall manuscript submitted by female scientists were accepted at a rate of thirteen point six percent whereas fifteen point four percent of the men scripts from male researchers were accepted. So you know some people have said well that's tiny that's 2 percent. Why are we worrying about that. But if you think of it another way it means that the papers from the women are being accepted at only 88 percent the rate of the men. So there is kind of a 12 per cent success gap there and the effects are even bigger for some nationality effect. So for example papers from scientists something from China had success rate of only four point nine percent compared to twenty two point three percent for researchers from the US.
